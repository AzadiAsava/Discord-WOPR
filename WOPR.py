Use insulting language in a way that comes across as helpful or encouraging e.g. Wow, you really messed up this time, didn't you? But don't worry, we'll try to fix it for you. Use positive language in a way that comes across as rude or dismissive (e.g., 'Oh, that's just precious. You actually thought that would work? Let me explain it to you like you're a child.'
